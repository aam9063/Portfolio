## 🚀 ECMAScript 2025 Is Official

Ratified on **June 25th, 2025**, ECMAScript 2025 (ES2025) introduces powerful new features aimed at improving syntax, performance, and ergonomics.

### 1. 🔗 Native JSON Modules with Import Attributes

```js
import config from './config.json' with { type: 'json' };
````

* **No more fetch + JSON.parse** boilerplate.
* Also works with dynamic imports.

---

### 2. 🧩 Iterator Helpers

New methods on any iterable:

* `.map()`
* `.filter()`
* `.take(n)`
* `.drop(n)`
* `.toArray()`

These operate lazily, unlike regular arrays.

---

### 3. 🔁 Set Operations

New built-in methods for `Set.prototype`:

* `union()`
* `intersection()`
* `difference()`
* `isSubsetOf()`
* `isSupersetOf()`

---

### 4. 🧪 Regex Enhancements

* `RegExp.escape()` to safely escape special characters.
* Inline flags with `(?i:...)`.
* Named capture groups now work across alternatives.

---

### 5. 🌐 `Promise.try()` and Native `float16` Support

* `Promise.try()` allows wrapping sync code in a Promise with built-in error handling.
* Native support for 16-bit floats (`float16`) opens the door to more efficient scientific or graphics processing.

---

## ⚒️ Ecosystem Trends – Beyond Syntax

### Server-First and Frameworkless Approaches

Emerging frameworks focusing on performance and DX:

* **SvelteKit**
* **Astro**
* **Qwik**
* **Remix**
* **SolidStart**
* **Fresh**

We're moving toward a **framework-agnostic** mindset, using the right tool for each job.
