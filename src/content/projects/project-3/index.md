**TrendsShop** is a client-side e‑commerce web app designed for seamless shopping interactions.

Built with **React 19** and styled using **TailwindCSS**, it offers:
- Product catalog display with responsive grid and filtering
- Detailed product views, with images, descriptions, and pricing
- Functional shopping cart with add/remove items and quantity adjustment
- Checkout page structuring order summary (currently front‑end mockup)
- Integration with a RESTful API for fetching and managing products

Architecture highlights:
- Modular, reusable React components for UI consistency
- State management with React context and hooks
- Asynchronous data fetching, error handling, and loading states

This project showcases a polished, production-ready React frontend and serves as a solid foundation for integrating user authentication, real payments, and backend services later.
